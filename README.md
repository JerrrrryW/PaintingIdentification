# Computer-Aided Tool for Painting Authentication

## Introduction

This project aims to develop a computer-aided tool for painting identification based on computer vision technology. The long history of Chinese civilization has left behind a large number of calligraphy and painting works that need to be preserved from authenticity and removed from falsehood. However, there is no unified rule to follow in the process of identifying calligraphy and painting, and there is a great deal of subjectivity. Therefore, this project will use graphics algorithms and deep learning methods to analyze authentic and counterfeit works.

## Purpose

The purpose of this graduation project is to assist experts in improving the efficiency and accuracy of painting identification. The project will research and develop various feature extraction methods and classification algorithms to improve the accuracy of painting identification. A user-friendly graphical interface will also be developed to facilitate users to upload paintings that require identification and quickly obtain identification results.

## Basic Conditions and Requirements

This project will focus on researching the following content:

1. Research on Feature Extraction Methods for Imagery Simulation of Paintings: This research will extract imaging simulation features that can represent painting features, including global features such as color, texture, shape, force, and stroke features.

2. Research on Modeling Methods for Painting Discrimination Models Based on Multi-layer Feature Indicators: By fusing different imaging simulation features together, a multi-layer feature index model is established to assist experts in overall evaluation of the painting. At the same time, for each parameter in the model, it will also be optimized and adjusted, exploring new feature analysis methods to improve the accuracy and interpretability of the model.

3. Implementation of a Sub-module for Text Recognition and Seal Database Matching in the Drawing Withdrawal Section: Through deep learning technology, the recognition of withdrawal parts in paintings and database matching after seal segmentation are achieved, facilitating professionals to horizontally compare the most valuable image elements and improving the accuracy and efficiency of identification.

This project aims to achieve an accurate and interpretable computer-aided painting identification tool, which will bring certain theoretical and practical value to the research and practice of painting identification.

## Calculation Requirements and Number of Various Drawings

The main goal of this graduation project is to achieve a computer-aided tool for painting identification. By studying the extraction of image simulation features and modeling of multi-layer feature indicators, the overall identification of paintings can be achieved. Specifically, we hope to improve accuracy and interpretability, and to bring certain theoretical and practical value to the research and practice of painting identification.
